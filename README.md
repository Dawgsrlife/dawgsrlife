## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex, and I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. I'm interested in specializing in the field (theory, AI/ML, systems and architecture, cybersecurity, data science and databases, etc.), but with a particular focus on full-stack software development!

- ðŸ’¡ I'm currently learning how to develop the software to automate trading and investments!
- ðŸŒ± I've recently acquired a plethora of design patterns, trained under a SCRUM workflow from my studies in CSC207 - Software Design: [Team SCRUM Workflow Project](https://github.com/Dawgsrlife/CSC207-A2-Final/blob/master/Assignment2/scrum/sprintBacklog4.txt) | [Code](https://github.com/Dawgsrlife/CSC207-A2-Final/blob/master/Assignment2/src/main/java/ca/utoronto/utm/assignment2/paint/Paint.java)
- ðŸ‘¯ Check out my contributions to [Eterna](https://github.com/Dawgsrlife/Eterna) and [TalkBox](https://github.com/Liam-Lee-66/TalkBox)
- ðŸŽº Check out my game of [Sokoban](https://github.com/Dawgsrlife/Sokoban-Game/blob/main/sokobangame.s), written in RISC-V Assembly
